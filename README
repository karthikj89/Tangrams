Set up an Android emulator in eclipse. Minimum api level should be Level 4.

In order to run the application we need to open up the project in eclipse and
push the play button. This will run the application and open the android emulator.
Once the application is opened you can navigate through the application by clicking
on whatever buttons that you want.
